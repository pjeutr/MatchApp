Comments on making match on the NK-980IoT

In the nuwriter dir are the images, that can be used to flash to the board.  
When the cli version of nuwriter is used, you can use ``` sudo ../NUC980_NuWriter_CMD/nuwriter nuwriter/flash.ini ```
uImage contains a prototype webapp using lighttpd and php, it uses dhcp to get an network adress

After buildroot is run, the new images can be writen with
sudo ../NUC980_NuWriter_CMD/nuwriter nuwriter/fresh.ini

In the overlay dir are configuration files in /etc/
And the webapp is in /var/www

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make nuvoton_nuc972_defconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

If users need to modiy buildroot parameters, user can run 'make menuconfig'
to modify buildroot parameters.

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

If users need to install nuc970_bsp , user need to be root to run 
'./install_bsp.sh' to install nuc970_bsp.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
